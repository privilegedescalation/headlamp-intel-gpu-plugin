description: >-
  Headlamp plugin for Intel GPU device plugin visibility and monitoring.
  Surfaces GpuDevicePlugin CRD status, GPU-capable nodes with capacity and
  allocation, pods requesting Intel GPU resources, and injects Intel GPU
  sections into native Node and Pod detail pages. Supports discrete (i915),
  Xe, and integrated GPU nodes with graceful degradation when the device
  plugin operator is not installed.
